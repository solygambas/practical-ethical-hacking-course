# Attacking Active Directory - Post-Compromise Enumeration

## Introduction

- use the compromised account to enumerate again.
- powerview is no longer updated and gets picked by antivirus, so we won't see it.
- tools will change, concepts will remain

- `mkdir marvel.local`
- `cd marvel.local`
- `ldapdomaindump ldap://192.168.92.139 -u 'MARVEL\fcastle' -p Password1`
- we get domain admins, users, groups. Check also domain policy and computers. Check what's available to us.
