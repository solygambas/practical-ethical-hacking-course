# We've Compromised the Domain - Now What?

## Post-Domain Compromise Attack Strategy

### Maximize Value for the Client

After compromising a domain, it's crucial to provide comprehensive value to the client by:

- **Identifying Additional Security Issues**: Conduct thorough scans and analyses to uncover other vulnerabilities within the network.

- **Dumping the NTDS.dit and Cracking Passwords**: Extract and analyze the NTDS.dit file to retrieve and crack user passwords, gaining deeper insights into potential security weaknesses.

- **Enumerating Shares for Sensitive Information**: Investigate shared resources to identify and report any sensitive or critical information that may be improperly exposed.

### Plan for Persistent Access

Ensure you have strategies in place to maintain access, even if initial entry points are lost:

- **Contingency for Domain Admin Account Loss**: Plan for scenarios where access to the compromised domain admin account might be revoked.

- **Create a Temporary Domain Admin Account**: Establish a new domain admin account for testing purposes. This should be detectable by the client as part of their security measures. Remember to delete the account after the engagement concludes.

- **Create a Golden Ticket**: Use Kerberos golden ticket attacks to establish long-term access by forging Kerberos tickets for any account, effectively bypassing traditional authentication mechanisms.

### Celebrate Your Success

Once your tasks are complete, take a moment to acknowledge your achievements with a small ritual or celebration. It's important to recognize the hard work and expertise involved in successfully executing these complex tasks.
