# Sudo overview

sudo: super user do!

`cat /etc/shadow` will be denied if you're not a super user

`sudo su -` to switch user to root (super user)

# Navigating the file system

- `root` is the user
- `kali` is the host
- `pwd` print working directory
- `ctrl L` clean terminal
- `ls` list folders and files
- `ls -la` long all (hidden files) https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=ls+-la or `man ls` or `ls --help`
- `cd /` to give absolute path
- `cd ~` to go home
- `mkdir` create directory
- `rmdir` remove directory
- `echo 'hi!'` to print hi!
- `echo 'hi!' > test.txt` to print hi! to a txt file
- `cat test.txt` to print out the file hi!
- `cp test.txt Downloads/` to copy file to a subfolder
- `rm Downloads/test.txt` to remove a file
- `mv test.txt Downloads/` to move a file
- `find / -name 'test.txt'`
- `passwd` to update your password (password)

# Users & privileges

drwxr-xr-x

- d for directory
- rwx read, write, execute for the owner
- r-x group can read and execute (cannot write)
- r-x all other users can read and execute (cannot write)

for pentesting, we look for full access

temp directory: drwxrwxrwt (full access)

- `echo 'hello' > hello.txt` (read & write permissions by default)
- `chmod` to change mode
- `chmod +rwx hello.txt` the file is now green (only for owner: -rwxr-xr-x)
- `chmod 777 hello.txt` will give -rwxrwxrwx (7 for rwx), 644 rw for owner, read for the others

creating another user:

- `adduser john` (useradd)
- `su john`
- `cat /etc/passwd` at the bottom we can see the user
- `cat /etc/shadow` to see the passwords
- `cat /etc/sudoers` to see who has to sudo
- `grep 'sudo' /etc/group` to see the users part of the group

best practice: we don't want to have a root password, to enforce people to log with their account and be granted the sudo privilege

windows: same hash for the same password, not the case on linux

# Common network commands

- `ip a` to get your ip (colorful)
    
- `ifconfig` (old way to do it)
    
- `iwconfig` for wireless connections
    
- `ip n` for neighbors (colorful)
    
- `arp -a`Â  what ip address is associated with what mac address (old way to do it)
    
- `ip r` routing table (colorful), can be different than ip a, we can discover routes to "open" to the external network
    
- `route` (old way to do it)
    
- `ping 192.168.138.2` ctrl C to stop on linux (loop), only 4 packets sent out on windows (ipconfig)
    
- `ping WIKIHOW.COM` https://www.wikihow.com/Ping-an-IP-Address
    
- `ping 127.0.0.1` ping yourself
    
- `netstat` to see open ports
    

some machines doesn't allow icmp traffic, no response doesn't mean it's not online

# Viewing, Creating, & Editing files

- `echo "hello" > hey.txt`
- `echo "hello again" >> hey.txt` will add to the text file
- `touch newfile.txt`
- `nano newfile.txt` ctrl X when you're done editing
- `cat newfile.txt`  
    nano, vi, vim (impossible to quit vim jokes)  
    https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/oev9pl/im_tired_of_seeing_cant_exit_vim_jokes/  
    mousepad gui, gedit (old)

# Starting and Stopping Services

- `sudo service apache2 start` (old way to do it)
- connect yourself to your ip in your browser, you will see a apache2 debian page, with the path where you can put files
- `sudo service apache2 stop`
- `python3 -m http.server 80`
- `python -m http.server` on windows, will work on http://localhost:8000/ (reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server)
- `sudo systemctl enable ssh` to enable it when launching the computer (keep it disable `sudo systemctl disable ssh`, security best practice)

# Installing and Updating Tools

`su ~` to go to the root
`sudo apt update && apt upgrade`

- update will check for packages we could update
- upgrade will do the actual update
- upgrading on kali linux can break things! always have a backup copy of your linux

`apt install package` to install a package

brute force o365 github: the kind of search you can make to find tools available on github repos
check the number of stars, forks and latest commit

pimpmykali.sh to fix some issues with the current kali distribution
create a `opt` folder and clone the repo
run the script and enter `N` for a new installation

# Bash Scripting

- `ping 172.17.0.1 -c 1 > ip.txt` to ping once
- `cat ip.txt | grep "64 bytes"` to find the line starting with 64 bytes
- `cat ip.txt | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4  | tr -d ":"` cutting out the ip address, d stands for delimiter, we want the 4th field, translate to remove the semi-colon
- `chmod +x ipsweep.sh`
- `for ip in $(cat ips.txt); do nmap $ip & done` one line to explore all the IPs
