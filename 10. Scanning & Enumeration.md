# Scanning & Enumeration

## Installing Kioptrix

2021 update

- https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/
- we'll actually use https://tcm-sec.com/kioptrix, download the kioptrix ova file
- import the ova file as a new virtual machine in vmware, allocate 256 Mo of memory, check that NAT is enabled.

## Scanning with Nmap

- play, kioptrix login is `john`, password is `TwoCows2`
- `ping 8.8.8.8` to know your target ip address
- `ifconfig` on your kali linux machine to get your ip address
- `arp-scan -l` to identify IPs of vmware machines
- `netdiscover -r 192.168.92.0/24` to explore the subnet and find the target ip address, `ctrl C` to quit.

Nmap stands for network mapper, scans for open ports (stealth scanning, but nowadays is very detectable). The port says it's opened, that's just what we want to know.

- `nmap -T4 -p- -A 192.168.92.129`, speed T from 1 to 5, 4 is a personal preference, `-p-` to scan all ports (top 1000 ports if not provided, 65535 with `-p-`), `-A` to get all the information it can get. `-A` takes longer, so it's better to first know the open ports, and run a second command specific to these ports with `-p 22,80 -A`
- `nmap --help` to see all the available options.

Now, we need to find exploits on these info.

## Enumerating HTTP and HTTPS Part 1

- wannacry was using a flaw in smb.
- we're looking for low hanging fruit, ssh is difficult.
- let's start with ports 80 and 443.
- go back to use system proxy settings in firefox settings.
- let's open `http://192.168.92.129` and `https://192.168.92.129` in firefox
- we now know it's using apache on red hat linux. Maybe other directories available, or they just forgot about it (poor hygiene).
- the 404 gives us the apache version and the internal host name `kioptrix.level1`.

## Enumerating HTTP and HTTPS Part 2

dirbuster, dirb, gobuster to do directory

- run `dirbuster&`
- `http://192.168.92.129:80` as target, activate go faster
- browse to add this list: `/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`
- `php` for file extensions (zip, txt, adapt to the stack, asp or aspx for microsoft)
- start the scan, use tree and results views to check the findings (right click to open in browser php files).
- inspect source code, look for info disclosure in comments, keys, passwords.
- usage.html: `Webalizer Version 2.01`

While we're waiting:

- reactivate your firefox proxy, open burp suite, intercept on in proxy, right click & send to repeater.
- new repeater tab should show. We can now edit the request and send it.
- in the target tab, we can edit the scope. Add `http://192.168.92.129/` and say yes.

Have a methodology, whatever the port is:

- look for service version info
- look for back-end directories
- look for potential vulnerabilities with nikto
- look for the stack with wappalyzer

## Enumerating SMB

smb file share

### Metasploit

- run `msfconsole` in the terminal. Metasploit is for exploitation, port scanning, post exploitation.
- type `search smb`. In results, type is the first element (exploit, auxiliary), then we have the type of action.
- `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version`, then type `info` to know the module behavior or `options` to get directly the options. `RHOSTS` is the remote host (the target).
- `set RHOSTS 192.168.92.129` and `run`

Notes

```
SMB - Unix (Samba 2.2.1a)
```

you'll be successful if you have the ability to gather info and enumerate properly.

### smbclient

to connect & see potential shared files.

- open a new terminal tab, enter `smbclient -L \\\\192.168.92.129\\`, type enter when asked for a password.
- two folders, we try `smbclient -L \\\\192.168.92.129\\ADMIN$` and `\\\\192.168.92.129\\IPC$`, anonymous login successful, but access to the files is denied (when doing `ls`)

## Enumerating SSH

Notes

```
OpenSSH 2.9p2 (protocol 1.99)
```

- run `ssh 192.168.92.129` or `ssh 192.168.92.129 -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -c aes128-cbc` because the target is old. Type `yes` to confirm you want to connect. Password asked, so it's over for the info gathering part (sometimes we get info disclosure about the SSH version in a banner). Spray and pray (brute force).

80, then 433, then 139/445

We look for `mod_ssl 2.8.7 exploit` on Google. Read the code, make sure it can't do harm to your own machine.

```
80/443 - Potentially vulnerable to OpenLuck (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/764), https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck
```

We also check `Apache 1.3.20 exploit`. On cvedetails, red flags are interesting (https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-45/product_id-66/version_id-371592/Apache-Http-Server-1.3.20.html?page=1&cvssscoremin=8&order=1&trc=8&sha=6d26d89b3754eda3acf4098d3cc8bf718f8405f6).

We then proceed with `Samba 2.2.1a exploit`. Rapid7 makes metasploit (https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/samba/trans2open/). We do have anonymous access to IPC.

```
139 - Potentially vulnerable to trans2open (https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/samba/trans2open/), https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7, https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/10
```

If you have no remote access, you can use `searchsploit`. For example, `searchsploit Samba 2.2.1a`:

```
