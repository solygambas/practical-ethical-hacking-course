# Passive Recon Overview

## physical/social

location info: satellite images, drone reco, building layout (badge readers, break areas, security, fencing)

job information: employees (name, job title, phone number, manager), pictures (badge photos, desk photos, computer photos)

share a cigarette with someone and enter the building

know in advance how people look like

photo with your laptop open, we can see all the tools you use at work

"I work for IT", you should know who is your manager

## web/host

target validation: whois, nslookup, dnsrecon

finding subdomains: google fu, dig, nmap, sublist3r, bluto, crt.sh

fingerprinting: nmap, wappalyzer, whatweb, builtwith, netcat (what's running?)

data breaches: haveibeenpwnd, breach-parse, weleakinfo (most common way to enter a network)

even if the customer is providing an ip, you should check it, otherwise you could attack the wrong person

# Identifying Our Target

(read the program details before attacking)

# Discovering Email Addresses

can also help to find leads

https://hunter.io/ (25 free monthly searches)

discover the pattern when you check tesla.com

`{f}{last}<span style="color: #4c555e;">@tesla.com</span>`

export in csv

https://phonebook.cz/

https://clearbit.com/resources/tools/connect (chrome extension, 100 emails per month)

https://www.voilanorbert.com/ (50 for free)

1.  google search: who is in this role at the company?
2.  phonebook.cz or hunter.io to understand the email pattern
3.  https://tools.emailhippo.com/ or https://email-checker.net/ to verify email without having to interact with the email owner (sometimes you can get false positives)

forgot password is not to be underestimated

on google, `pleasedonthackmesirplz@gmail.com`

welcome after entering an email means we have a valid email address

try another method,

get an email: <span style="color: #1f1f1f;">`h••••@tc•••••.com` (proof of a link between two pieces of data)</span>

# Breached Credentials Part 1

go to https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse

the torrent is 44gb

run `./breach-parse.sh @tesla.com tesla.txt`

3 files: tesla-master, tesla-passwords, tesla-users

some people are using their company emails for accessing online services

credential stuffing

look for repeating offenders, someone is appearing twice, with a similar password

test different casing since he's modifying a little bit the case from one password to another

# Breached Credentials Part 2

websites can change, the methodology will remain the same

https://www.dehashed.com/ (costly)

we can search by many fields (password, username, ip)

if the password is specific enough and used is various accounts, we might get access to one of his accounts

being to be able to relate

@tesla.com, look for interesting things, link an account to another, find patterns

search by password: tesla.com, mail.ru, dropbox, same user

combine operators to find a specific person

hashes.org closed

https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ohlcye/hashesorg_archives_of_all_cracked_hash_lists_up/

use https://hashmob.net/search

you can also search the hash on google

# Hunting Subdomains Part 1

you need to have a complete representation of what you're trying to enter: don't limit yourself to the main entrance, you can have many subdomains to explore

sublist3r

`apt install sublist3r`

`sublist3r -d tesla.com -t 100` (to have more threads)

https://crt.sh/ as an alternative

search for `%.tesla.com`you look for dev/sso/api-toolbox

you look for any indication of tools they may use internally

you can also explore sub sub domains

# Hunting Subdomains Part 2

87 subdomains

https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass is a very popular tool written in go

`docker run -v OUTPUT_DIR_PATH:/.config/amass/ caffix/amass enum -d tesla.com`

https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe check if your findings are working

# Identifying Website Technologies

https://builtwith.com/

look at the frameworks and cms

https://wappalyzer.com/

drupal, php

we sometimes have the version number

great way to try known security vulnerabilities

`whatweb https://tesla.com`

drupal 8  
php 7.3.7  
headers

combine sources to gather more info

# Gathering Information w/ Burp Suite

burp suite community edition is included

temp project > start

firefox: preferences > connection settings > manual proxy configuration

http proxy: 127.0.0.1 on port 8080

check use this proxy server for all protocols

https://burp in a new tab, allow the certificate (save the file)

firefox: references > privacy & security > certificates > click on view certificates

import the downloaded file, check the two checkboxes and click ok

burp will intercept the queries you receive and log them

click forward to pass them

response with php version and drupal version, a server name

burp pro to automatically scan for vulnerabilities

# Google Fu

being good at google will be super useful!

https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/

- `site:tesla.com`
- `site:tesla.com -www`
- `site:tesla.com -www -shop`
- `site:tesla.com filetype:docx`
-  `site:tesla.com filetype:pdf`

looking for sensitive files
sometimes you can find a backup file with credentials

# Utilizing Social Media

linkedin, twitter
images with employee photos
look at the photo tab on facebook pages
sometimes a badge is showing

linkedin is great to find the people
use a peeping account
you have the email pattern
write a script to scrape the names from linkedin and generate email addresses
people are always the weakest point of an organization
weak password somewhere

keep repeating this kind of reco, you will get good at it
