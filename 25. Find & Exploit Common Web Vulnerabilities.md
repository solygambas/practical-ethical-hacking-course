# Find & Exploit Common Web Vulnerabilities

## Lab Setup

### With PimpMyKali

1. To install Docker and Docker Compose, run [PimpMyKali](https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali) with `./pimpmykali.sh` and select option 7.

2. To set up the labs, run [PimpMyKali](https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali) again with `./pimpmykali.sh` and select option E.

### Custom Setup

1. Alternatively, open a terminal on your Kali Linux virtual machine and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.29.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

2. Verify that Docker Compose is installed correctly:

   ```bash
   docker-compose version
   ```

3. Restart your virtual machine.

4. Download the web labs from TCM's link: [**labs**](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/NgPnyKOwSfWYuwnX3Lzb).

5. Copy the labs to your desired location and extract the files:

   ```bash
   tar -xf peh-web-labs.tar.gz
   cd labs
   sudo docker-compose up
   ```

   > The last command starts multiple containers using a single YAML file. You can also run it in the background using `-d` (detached mode).

### Running the Lab

The first time you run the lab, it will take some time to download necessary dependencies. Subsequent runs will be much faster. Once you see that `mysqld` and `mysqlx` are "ready for connections," the setup is complete.

1. Set the necessary permissions for the web server, which is required for the file upload labs and the capstone challenge. Run the following command in a separate terminal tab (use `Ctrl+Shift+T` to open a new tab):

   ```bash
   ./set-permissions.sh
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost).

3. The first time you load the lab, the database will need to be initialized. Follow the instructions in the red box by clicking the link, then return to the homepage.

> **Note:** If at any point you mess up the tables or database of the labs, you can reset it by visiting [http://localhost/init.php](http://localhost/init.php).
