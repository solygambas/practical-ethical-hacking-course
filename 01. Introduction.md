PNPT (practical network penetration tester)  
Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP, also known as OffSec Certified Professional) is an ethical hacking certification offered by Offensive Security (or OffSec) that teaches penetration testing methodologies and the use of the tools included with the Kali Linux distribution (successor of BackTrack). The OSCP is a hands-on penetration testing certification, requiring holders to successfully attack and penetrate various live machines in a safe lab environment. It is considered more technical than other ethical hacking certifications, and is one of the few certifications that requires evidence of practical penetration testing skills. 1000 hours. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_Security_Certified_Professional
