### Edit VMware Configuration File:

You need to edit the VMware configuration file to set a default keyboard layout. Follow these steps:

1. **Close VMware Workstation Pro.**
2. **Open the VMware Workstation configuration file for editing.** This file is usually named `config` and is located in one of the following directories, depending on your operating system:
   - **Windows:** `C:\ProgramData\VMware\VMware Workstation\config.ini`
   - **Linux:** `/etc/vmware/config`
3. **Add the following line to the configuration file:**
   ```ini
   xkeymap.language = "fr"
   ```
4. Save the file and restart VMware Workstation Pro.

### Configure Guest OS Keyboard Layout:

In your Kali Linux VM, you can set the keyboard layout permanently by modifying the X11 configuration files:

- Open a terminal in Kali Linux.
- Edit the keyboard configuration file:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/default/keyboard
```

- Change or add the following lines to set the keyboard layout to AZERTY (French):

```sh
XKBMODEL="pc105"
XKBLAYOUT="fr"
XKBVARIANT=""
XKBOPTIONS=""
```

- Save the file and close the editor.
- Update the initramfs:

```sh
sudo update-initramfs -u
```

- Reboot your Kali Linux VM to apply the changes:

```sh
sudo reboot
```

### Troubleshoot and resolve network connectivity issues

1. Check VMware Network Adapter Settings:
   Ensure that your virtual machine's network adapter is set to NAT.
   - Open VMware Workstation Pro.
   - Select your Kali Linux VM and go to Settings.
   - Click on Network Adapter and ensure that NAT is selected.
2. Restart Networking Services in Kali Linux:
   - Open a terminal in Kali Linux.
   - Edit the NetworkManager Configuration File:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
```

Ensure it contains:

```sh
[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile

[ifupdown]
managed=true
```

- Restart the network services:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

3. Check Network Interface Configuration:
   Enable NetworkManager Networking:

```sh
sudo nmcli networking on
```

Bring Up the Interface:

```sh
sudo ip link set eth0 up
```

Verify that the network interface is properly configured:

```sh
ip a
```

Look for an interface like eth0 or ens33. It should have an IP address assigned (typically in the range 192.168.x.x).

4. Check DNS Configuration:

Ensure that the DNS configuration is correct:

```sh
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

You should see a nameserver entry, like:

```sh
nameserver 192.168.x.2
```

5. Configure Network Manually:
   If the network interface is not configured, set it up manually:

```sh
sudo nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname eth0 con-name my-ethernet
sudo nmcli connection modify my-ethernet connection.autoconnect yes
sudo nmcli connection up my-ethernet
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

6. Verify Connectivity:
   Check if you can reach the internet:

```sh
ping -c 4 google.com
```

## virtualbox

virtual box extension pack is needed if you want to use virtualbox

- preferences > extensions
- click plus and add your download
- network tab: add nat network
- for every machine, go to settings, network, make sure nat network is selected
