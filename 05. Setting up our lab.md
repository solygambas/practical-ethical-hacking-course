## Edit VMware Configuration File:

You need to edit the VMware configuration file to set a default keyboard layout. Follow these steps:

1. **Close VMware Workstation Pro.**
2. **Open the VMware Workstation configuration file for editing.** This file is usually named `config` and is located in one of the following directories, depending on your operating system:
   - **Windows:** `C:\ProgramData\VMware\VMware Workstation\config.ini`
   - **Linux:** `/etc/vmware/config`
3. **Add the following line to the configuration file:**
   ```ini
   xkeymap.language = "fr"
   ```
4. Save the file and restart VMware Workstation Pro.

## Configure Guest OS Keyboard Layout:

In your Kali Linux VM, you can set the keyboard layout permanently by modifying the X11 configuration files:

- Open a terminal in Kali Linux.
- Edit the keyboard configuration file:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/default/keyboard
```

- Change or add the following lines to set the keyboard layout to AZERTY (French):

```sh
XKBMODEL="pc105"
XKBLAYOUT="fr"
XKBVARIANT=""
XKBOPTIONS=""
```

- Save the file and close the editor.
- Update the initramfs:

```sh
sudo update-initramfs -u
```

- Reboot your Kali Linux VM to apply the changes:

```sh
sudo reboot
```
