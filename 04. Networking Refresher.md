# Networking Refresher

## 1\. IP addresses

ifconfig on kali

ipconfig on windows

inet decimal (32 bits, 4.3 billions possible adresses)

inet6 hexadecimal (128 bits)

layer 3 protocols: routing

192.168 is a private ip address (class c), 0 to 255 for the 3rd and fourth chunks, 254 possible hosts

10.0.0.0 class a, for big businesses, 16,6 million possible hosts

172.16 to 172.31 class b, 65k possible hosts

localhost 127.0.0.0

## 2\. MAC addresses

physical addresses

layer 2: switching

media access control

windows

command invit

ipconfig /all

84:4B:F5 -> foxconn

## 3\. TCP, UDP, & the Three-Way Handshake

tcp: transmission control protocol

three-way handshake to connect to a port: syn > syn ack > ack

wireshark to monitor traffic

443 is a webpage

udp: user datagram protocol (streaming) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol

## 4\. Common ports and protocols

tcp

- ftp 21
- ssh 22 (encripted login)
- telnet 23 (log remotely)
- smtp 25
- dns 53 (domain name system)
- http 80
- https 443
- pop3 110
- smb 139 + 445 (most common: file shares, WannaCry ransomware attack https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack)
- imap 143

udp

- dns 53
- dhcp 67, 68 (random/static ip address when you surf the internet)
- tftp 69 (trivial ftp)
- snmp 161

## 5\. the OSI model

- Layer 1 - Please - Physical layer: data cables, cat6
- Layer 2 - Do - Data layer: switching, MAC addresses
- Layer 3 - Not - Network layer: IP addresses, routing
- Layer 4 - Throw - Transport layer: TCP/UDP
- Layer 5 - Sausage - Session layer: session management
- Layer 6 - Pizza - Presentation layer: jpgeg, mov
- Layer 7 - Away - Application layer: http, smtp

troubleshoot at helpdesk: always start from layer 1 down to 7 (is the cable pluged in?)

## 6\. Subnetting: part 1

https://ipcisco.com/subnetting-cheat-sheet/

subnet number of possibilities of the bits to be flipped on

- 8: 255.0.0.0
- 16: 255.255.0.0
- 24: 255.255.255.0

subnet mask can be guessed according to the number of bits which are flipped on

pentestiing: knowing in advance how many devices you're possibly in front of

- /24 small businesses (254 possible hosts)
- /16 bigger companies

example:

- 192.168.1.0/24
- subnet: 255.255.255.0
- network ip: often the first address available 192.168.1.0
- broadcast is often the last one: 192.168.1.255
- range available to us is in between (254 hosts)

&nbsp;

- 192.168.1.0/28
- subnet: 255.255.255.240
- network ip: often the first address available 192.168.1.0
- broadcast is often the last one: 192.168.1.15
- range available to us is in between (14 hosts)

&nbsp;

- 192.168.1.16/28 (subnets for each type of devices within the company)
- subnet: 255.255.255.240
- network ip: often the first address available 192.168.1.16
- broadcast is often the last one: 192.168.1.31
- range available to us is in between (14 hosts)

&nbsp;

- 192.168.1.0/23
- subnet: 255.255.254.0
- network ip: often the first address available 192.168.0.0
- broadcast is often the last one: 192.168.1.255
- 2 ranges available to us is in between (510 hosts)

&nbsp;

- 192.168.0.0/22
- subnet: 255.255.252.0
- network ip: often the first address available 192.168.0.0
- broadcast is often the last one: 192.168.3.255
- 4 ranges available to us is in between (1022 hosts)

&nbsp;

- 192.168.1.0/26
- subnet: 255.255.255.192
- network ip: often the first address available 192.168.1.0
- broadcast is often the last one: 192.168.1.63
- 2 ranges available to us is in between (62 hosts)

&nbsp;

- 192.168.1.0/27
- subnet: 255.255.255.224
- network ip: often the first address available 192.168.1.0
- broadcast is often the last one: 192.168.1.31
- 2 ranges available to us is in between (30 hosts)

&nbsp;we could create a second subnet starting at 192.168.1.32/27 (8 different segments could be made)

remember: if the last number grows, you're dealing with less possible hosts
