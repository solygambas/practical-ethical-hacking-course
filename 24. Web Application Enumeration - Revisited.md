# Web Application Enumeration, Revisited

## Installing Go

To install Go. All we need to do is run [pimpmykali](https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali) with `./pimpmykali.sh`, and select option 3.

## Finding Subdomains with Assetfinder

- Install [Assetfinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder): `go install github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder@latest`
- Find subdomains for a domain: `assetfinder tesla.com`
- Save the output to a file: `assetfinder tesla.com >> tesla-subs.txt`
- Check the number of subdomains found: `cat tesla-subs.txt| wc -l` gives 659
- Find subdomains without the parent domain in the results: `assetfinder --subs-only tesla.com`

### Automating the Filtering

- Create a script file: `gedit run.sh`
- Add the following script to `run.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

url=$1

if [ ! -d "$url" ];then
				mkdir $url
fi

if  [ ! -d "$url/recon" ];then
				mkdir $url/recon
fi

echo "[+] Harvesting subdomains with assetfinder...."
assetfinder $url >> $url/recon/assets.txt
cat $url/recon/assets.txt | grep $1 >> $url/recon/final.txt
rm $url/recon/assets.txt
```

- Make the script executable: `chmod +x run.sh`
- Run the script: `./run.sh tesla.com`
- Navigate to the results directory and view the final subdomain list: `cd tesla.com/recon` & `nano final.txt`

## Finding Subdomains with Amass

Combining tools is a great way to ensure no subdomains are missed.

- Install [Amass](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass): `go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master`
- Find subdomains for a domain: `amass enum -d tesla.com` (takes longer)
- Update the `run.sh` script:

```bash
echo "[+] Harvesting subdomains with Amass...."
amass enum -d $url >> $url/recon/amass.txt
sort -u $url/recon/amass.txt >> $url/recon/final.txt
rm $url/recon/amass.txt
```

## Finding Alive Domains with Httprobe

- Install [Httprobe](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe): `go install github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe@latest`
- Find alive subdomains for a domain: `cat tesla.com/recon/final.txt | httprobe -s -p https:443 | sed 's/https\?:\/\///' | tr -d ':443'`
- Update the `run.sh` script (see [the final file](/24-web-application-enumeration/run.sh)):

```bash
echo "[+] Probing for alive domains...."
cat $url/recon/final.txt | sort -u | httprobe -s -p https:443  | sed 's/https\?:\/\///' | tr -d ':443' >> $url/recon/alive.txt
```

- Run the script: `./run.sh tesla.com`
- Filter what interests you (e.g., dev, admin, test, stag): `cat tesla.com/recon/alive.txt | grep dev`

## Screenshotting Websites with GoWitness

GoWitness is a tool that automates taking screenshots of websites. This is particularly useful as it saves you from manually copying the IP of every domain and pasting it into a browser to see what the site looks like.

- Install [GoWitness](https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness): `go install github.com/sensepost/gowitness@latest`
- Take a simple screenshot: `gowitness single https://www.google.com`
- Check the screenshot: `cd screenshots`, then `ls`. You should see a PNG screenshot of the website.

## Automating the Enumeration Process

- [sumrecon](https://github.com/thatonetester/sumrecon): A tool designed to automate various aspects of recon.
- [TCM's Modified Script](https://pastebin.com/MhE6zXVt): This script enhances the automation process by adding functionality for subdomain takeover detection, open port scanning, and scraping wayback data for parameters and code files.
