# Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus

## Scanning with Nessus Part 1

- Download Nessus, open a terminal, `cd Downloads/` and `dpkg -i Nessus-10.7.4-ubuntu1404_amd64.deb` to depackage.
- `/bin/systemctl start nessusd.service` to start.
- open `https://kali:8834/#/`, add a ssl exception. Install nessus essentials, free, but limited to private addresses.
- once you're logged in and plugins finished to compile, create a new basic scan with target `192.168.92.129`.
- in discovery, select all ports.
- in assessment, scan for web vulnerabilities.
- save and launch.
- we get a report: https://kali:8834/#/scans/reports/8/hosts

A lot more options are available in advanced scan.

## Scanning with Nessus Part 2

Download the nessus file and convert it into an excel spreadsheet. Helpful for the client because we will only focus on the low-hanging fruit as pen testers.

Don't trust the vulnerability scanner, always check and take actual screenshots.

You will need to pay for nessus as a pen tester.
