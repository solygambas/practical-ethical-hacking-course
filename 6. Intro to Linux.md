# Sudo overview

# Sudo overview

sudo: super user do!

`cat /etc/shadow` will be denied if you're not a super user

`sudo su -` to switch user to root (super user)

# Navigating the file system

- `root` is the user
- `kali` is the host
- `pwd` print working directory
- `ctrl L` clean terminal
- `ls` list folders and files
- `ls -la` long all (hidden files) https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=ls+-la or `man ls` or `ls --help`
- `cd /` to give absolute path
- `cd ~` to go home
- `mkdir` create directory
- `rmdir` remove directory
- `echo 'hi!'` to print hi!
- `echo 'hi!' > test.txt` to print hi! to a txt file
- `cat test.txt` to print out the file hi!
- `cp test.txt Downloads/` to copy file to a subfolder
- `rm Downloads/test.txt` to remove a file
- `mv test.txt Downloads/` to move a file
- `find / -name 'test.txt'`
- `passwd` to update your password (password)

# Users & privileges

drwxr-xr-x

- d for directory
- rwx read, write, execute for the owner
- r-x group can read and execute (cannot write)
- r-x all other users can read and execute (cannot write)

for pentesting, we look for full access

temp directory: drwxrwxrwt (full access)

- `echo 'hello' > hello.txt` (read & write permissions by default)
- `chmod` to change mode
- `chmod +rwx hello.txt` the file is now green (only for owner: -rwxr-xr-x)
- `chmod 777 hello.txt` will give -rwxrwxrwx (7 for rwx), 644 rw for owner, read for the others

creating another user:

- `adduser john` (useradd)
- `su john`
- `cat /etc/passwd` at the bottom we can see the user
- `cat /etc/shadow` to see the passwords
- `cat /etc/sudoers` to see who has to sudo
- `grep 'sudo' /etc/group` to see the users part of the group

best practice: we don't want to have a root password, to enforce people to log with their account and be granted the sudo privilege

windows: same hash for the same password, not the case on linux

# Common network commands

- `ip a` to get your ip (colorful)
- `ifconfig` (old way to do it)
- `iwconfig` for wireless connections
- `ip n` for neighbors (colorful)
- `arp -a`Â  what ip address is associated with what mac address (old way to do it)
- `ip r` routing table (colorful), can be different than ip a, we can discover routes to "open" to the external network
- `route` (old way to do it)
- `ping 192.168.138.2` ctrl C to stop on linux (loop), only 4 packets sent out on windows (ipconfig)
- `ping WIKIHOW.COM` https://www.wikihow.com/Ping-an-IP-Address
- `ping 127.0.0.1` ping yourself
- `netstat` to see open ports

some machines doesn't allow icmp traffic, no response doesn't mean it's not online
